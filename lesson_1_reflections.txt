How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

	This difference can be a typo or bug i introduced since i guess 
	the old version worked just fine.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

	I can see step by step changes I made and go back if necessary,
 	I also can compare different versions

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

	Better for code not for simple text
	Save when I think itâ€™s important and when my code can be compiled ( not anytime)
	
Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because for one project multiple files can be connected and all necessary

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    First git log, to read the commits and to know what changed step by step
    Then git diff to truly see in the files what has been done

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Because I know I can go back to a working previous version 

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Of course!!
