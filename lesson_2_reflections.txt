What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	the file .git is created. NO commit is created.
	I need to do it to track versions of my files

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	staging area contains the tracked file(s). the repository contain different versions of tracked files. 
	In a working directory, you can choose the files you want to track.
